This repository contains the code for final year project by Emily Wood in award for Bsc degree in Biomedical and Molecular Diagnostics, Technological University Dublin, City Campus.


R programming software and version 3.6.1 (https://www.r-project.org/) was used. Additonally RStudio program, version 1.2.5019 (https://www.rstudio.com) was utilised for generation of this code and is denoted to as .R scripts.
Python programming language, version 3.9.2 (https://www.python.org/) was utilised in this code and is denotet as .ipynb scripts.

Code includes heatmaps generated for analysis heatmaps plotted using pheatmap packaging (Kolde, 2018). PCAs generated for prior analysis of data. DeSEQ2 scirpts are included (Love et al., 2014).  Scripts for VIPER analysis is incldued (Mariano J. Alvarez et al., 2016). Cluster analysis performed on R studio scripts are included. Code also includes generation of dataframes which were required for downstream analysis.
