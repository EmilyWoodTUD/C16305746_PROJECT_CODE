This repository contains the code for final year project in award for Bsc degree in Biomedical and Molecular Diagnostics submitted to School of Biological & Health Sciences, City Campus, Technological University Dublin.


Project Title: 
Computational Analysis of Drug Combinations to Normalize Aberrant Response of Macrophages to Mycobacterium Tuberculosis.


Code which was generated with R software, version 3.6.1 (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio, version 1.2.5019 (https://www.rstudio.com) is denoted to as .R scripts.
Code generated with Python Software, version 3.9.2 (https://www.python.org/) is denotet as .ipynb scripts.

Code includes heatmaps generated for analysis. PCAs generated for analysis of data. DeSEQ2 scirpts are included.  VIPER scripts included. cSTAR method on python for generation of the SVM, STV and DPD. Cluster analysis performed on R studio scripts are included. Code also includes generation of data sets which were required for downstream analysis.
