This repository contains the code for final year project in award for Bsc degree in Biomedical and Molecular Diagnostics submitted to School of Biological & Health Sciences, City Campus, Technological University Dublin.


Project Title: 
"Computational Analysis of Drug Combinations to Normalize Aberrant Response of Macrophages to Mycobacterium Tuberculosis"


R programming software and version 3.6.1 (https://www.r-project.org/) was used. Additonally RStudio program, version 1.2.5019 (https://www.rstudio.com) was utilised for generation of this code and is denoted to as .R scripts.
Python Software, version 3.9.2 (https://www.python.org/) was utilised in this code and is denotet as .ipynb scripts.

Code includes heatmaps generated for analysis heatmaps plotted using pheatmap packaging (Kolde, 2018). PCAs generated for prior analysis of data. DeSEQ2 scirpts are included (Love et al., 2014).  Scripts for VIPER analysis is incldued (Mariano J. Alvarez et al., 2016). Cluster analysis performed on R studio scripts are included. Code also includes generation of dataframes which were required for downstream analysis.
